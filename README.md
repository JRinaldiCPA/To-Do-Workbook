To Do Excel
My system entails a few Excel workbooks, the main one is my To Do. This is where I keep track of my Projects / Tasks / Waiting, document content for my Weekly GTD Review (ex. Improvements), and capture stray thoughts and notes from meetings. Macros are used to refresh the views and keep everything tidy.  My To Do lets me store all of this in something that isn’t my own head, and is meant to be a comprehensive inventory of all of my incomplete work.

Note: Remember, my to-do list is a working document, not some showy testament to organization that quietly gathers dust because I’m off doing real work that's not written down anywhere.

The To Do Excel workbook has the following sheets:

•	Projects: This sheet includes all my Projects to be completed. Details include the Area of Focus, Project objective, and current Project status, along with links to the Project Support folder and P.XXX support Excel. During the weekly review the status of each active Projects is updated, and next steps reassessed. 

•	Tasks: This sheet includes all of the specific Tasks that need to be completed. These are generally linked to a specific Project, or could be one off Tasks. Each Task should start with a verb, and we written so that it can be handed off to someone else (i.e. my “future self”). 
o	Whenever possible, I should try to group my Tasks together so that I logically do ones with a similar context at the same time. I also have separate lists (RefX) for like Tasks that NEED to be done at the same time, such as having a grocery list instead of having a Task called “buy milk”.
o	My Task list should be more like a pocket, instead of an attic, only put the essentials, everything else goes to Someday/Maybe or a Backlog.
o	If a task seems to complicated / involved I should try breaking it into smaller parts

Note: Tasks are filtered so that only Tasks with a start date prior to today are shown

•	Waiting: This sheet is for any Task / request that I am waiting on someone else to complete.

•	Questions: This sheet includes pending Questions about a Project or Task, that need to be asked to someone else.

•	Someday/Maybe:  This sheet includes all Projects / Tasks that I would potentially like to complete in the future, but I am either unsure I will complete, they are very low priority, or are only half-baked ideas.

•	Recurring: This sheet includes recurring Tasks, and is filtered to only show Tasks that are coming due, or past due, based on each Task’s set frequency.  I only track my Recurring in my Personal To Do	.

•	Temp: This sheet is a temporary storage location for notes from Daily to be curated, quick notes to myself or to do calculations and such. 

•	Daily: This sheet is a repository of all of my notes from meetings / conversations. I also track what I do at a high level here to aid in completing my weekly review and completing my Timecard.
